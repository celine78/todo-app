# TodoApp

The TodoApp is a simple and easy to use Todo Application which allows an user to create a list of todos.
Simplicity is the key word in this single-page application. To avoid a complex architecture, an in memory data storage has been used, only saving data during a session. After each refresh of a page, the data provided in the code is the only one surviving.

For using the application, a user first needs to register. Once on the main page, the new todos can be added. Created ones can be edited or deleted. A user can also edit its own profile or change its password.
